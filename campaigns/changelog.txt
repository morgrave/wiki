기존 캐릭터 파일들 중 업데이트된 파일의 내용 중 새로 추가되거나 변경된 부분만을 전부 출력해줘.

**Isolating New Content**

I'm zeroing in on the core request: pinpointing *only* the new or modified content within character files after an update. My primary task is to identify the crucial elements for a proper response. I need to understand what constitutes "new" or "changed" in this context.


**Analyzing Character Updates**

I'm now diving into specific character files from Episode 52. For "밀림의_왕.md," I see a new event: its defeat in the Delphi Temple forest. The combat details are clear: it used a shield against Bell, and was ultimately defeated by Larbion. The death and its impact are also noted: it was burned, leaving a will, and causing the withering of plants. Finally, its actions per round and specific stats are updated. I will now process the other target files in a similar fashion.


**Identifying Key File Changes**

I've examined additional character updates. For 벨.md, I registered a pivotal event: Bell's dinosaur transformation in pursuit of the Jungle King, along with combat details and riddle solutions, including the new 'Living Nature Robe.' Лаpбион.md displays his decisive blow against the Jungle King, exploration of the Abandoned Temple, and a new 'Mysterious Carpet'. I continue pinpointing the changes.


**Pinpointing Recent Updates**

I've zeroed in on the latest updates. In `빈센트.md`, I see Vincent using "Green Flame Blade," performing a "Blood Bond" ritual, and solving a puzzle involving a number pattern. I also tracked him countering Haru's charm, using "Counterspell," and mocking Haru. For `블라트나트.md`, I note the use of "Warding Bond" and "Cruel" in combat, taming new creatures, receiving a revelation, returning the 'Genesis Disk,' receiving the party's 'Long Rest' blessing, and encountering the transformed.


**Tracking Character Actions**

I've registered Haru's attempt at persuasion and a humorous revelation about Nat's savings being used for clothes. Haru cleared void darkness with "Dawn's Light" in combat. For `개추.md`, I've documented its return to normal size, "Flower-Chu" nickname, and following the party. I've also tracked Blatnat's mutations and terror, her summoning of elemental towers, and confession about the savings.
